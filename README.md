### 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with Osclass, follow these easy steps:
***

1. Download the latest zip package of Osclass from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/mindstellar/Osclass/releases) and
   unpack it in your web-server root, i.e. `public_html` directory.
2. Execute the Osclass installation script by accessing index.php `oc-includes/osclass/install.php` from your browser:
    * If you’ve installed it in the domain’s root directory, you’ll have to go to: `http://example.com/index.php` or
      directly to **http://example.com/oc-includes/osclass/install.php**
    * If you’ve installed it in a subdirectory inside the domain, classifieds, for example, go to: `http://example.com/classifieds/index.php` or directly to `http://example.com/classifieds/oc-includes/osclass/install.php`  
        This will lead you to osclass inbuilt installer.
3. Follow Osclass installer instructions:

      Make sure the server has the required permissions to write in the files and directories specified. This will allow you to create a basic configuration file as well as upload images, documents, etc.
     * #### Step 3.2  
       ![Step-2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindstellar/Osclass-Docs/master/.gitbook/assets/Installer-step-2.png)  
      Add your access details to the database. If you haven’t created it yet, the installer will ask for another account with permissions that will allow to do it for you.
     * #### Step 3.3
       ![Step-3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindstellar/Osclass-Docs/master/.gitbook/assets/installer-step-3.png)

### 📚 How to get latest version of Osclass
Checkout our [GitHub Release](https://github.com/mindstellar/Osclass/releases) section to get latest version of osclass.
 
Do not use master branch for your deployment, it may include untested code. Only use zip file provided in our release section.

### Run osclass locally using Docker #
First Clone the repository and the submodules.

```
$> git clone --recursive git@github.com:mindstellar/Osclass.git
```

Dependencies:

  * Docker engine v1.13 or higher. Your OS provided package might be a little old, if you encounter problems, do upgrade. See [https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation)

Once you're done, simply `cd` to Osclass directory and run `docker-compose up -d`. This will initialise and start all the containers, then leave them running in the background.

* #### Services exposed outside your environment ##
  You can access your application via **`localhost`**, if you're running the containers directly. nginx and mailhog both
  respond to any hostname, in case you want to add your own hostname on your `/etc/hosts`

  Service|Address outside containers
  ------|---------
  Webserver|[localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
  PhpMyAdmin web interface|[localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001)
  MySQL|**host:** `localhost`; **port:** `5002`
  Mailhog web interface|[localhost:5003](http://localhost:5003)

* #### Hosts for osclass docker environment ##

  You'll need to configure osclass to use enabled services:

  Service|Hostname|Port number
  ------|---------|-----------
  php-fpm|php-fpm|9000
  MySQL|mysql|3306 (default)
  Memcached|memcached|11211 (default)
  SMTP (Mailhog)|mailhog|1025 (default)

* #### Docker compose cheatsheet #

  **Note:** you need to cd first to where your docker-compose.yml file lives.

    * Start containers in the background: `docker-compose up -d`
    * Start containers on the foreground: `docker-compose up`. You will see a stream of logs for every container
      running.
    * Stop containers: `docker-compose stop`
    * Kill containers: `docker-compose kill`
    * View container logs: `docker-compose logs`
    * Execute command inside of container: `docker-compose exec SERVICE_NAME COMMAND` where `COMMAND` is whatever you
      want to run. Examples:
    * Shell into the PHP container, `docker-compose exec php-fpm bash`
    * Open a mysql shell, `docker-compose exec mysql mysql -uroot -pCHOSEN_ROOT_PASSWORD`
