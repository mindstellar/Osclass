/**
 * Every action a settings form posts must be routed by CAdminSettings::doModel().
 *
 * The switch there dispatches ?page=settings on its action, and its default arm renders
 * the General settings page. So an action the switch has no case for does not fail: the
 * request lands on a different settings page, the handler that would have written the
 * preferences never runs, and the values are discarded with no error and no flash. That
 * is how four of the billing page's five forms ("Pricing" -- which owns the seller
 * listing limit -- plus offline payments, upgrades and seller limits) silently saved
 * nothing while only the enable/disable toggle worked.
 *
 * Nothing here needs a database or a bootstrap: the views are scanned for the actions
 * they post, the controller for the cases it routes, and the two are compared. A new
 * settings form is covered the moment it is written.  Usage:
 *   php tests/admin-settings-routes.php
