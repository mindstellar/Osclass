/**
 * Split listing.premium's existence from its price, the same way 0030/0031 already did
 * for the six newer billing features: billing_premium_enabled is a new preference,
 * separate from billing_premium_credits, so featuring can be priced at 0 and still be
 * for sale -- something the old "0 credits means unavailable" rule could not express.
 *
 * This is a backfill, not just a seed. An install that already priced featuring
 * (billing_premium_credits > 0) gets billing_premium_enabled = 1, so it keeps selling
 * exactly what it was selling. An install at 0 credits -- which meant "unavailable"
 * under the old rule -- gets billing_premium_enabled = 0, so it stays unavailable.
 * Either way the change is invisible to an existing site.
 *
 * Idempotent: does nothing once the key exists, so a re-run after an interrupted
 * upgrade cannot overwrite an admin's own choice made since.
