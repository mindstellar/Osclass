/**
 * Make the location import's source id unique per country rather than globally.
 *
 * i_source_id records which row a location came from upstream, and 0023 made it unique
 * across the whole table. That holds only while every row came from one source. It stops
 * holding the moment the published dataset changes: the previous one numbered cities
 * 57,584-147,939, and the Wikidata ids replacing them start at 1, so the two ranges
 * overlap almost completely. Wikidata's id for Castlewellan in County Down is 58126,
 * which the old data had already issued to Bangarmau in Uttar Pradesh.
 *
 * With a global unique key those two rows cannot coexist, so importing the new data for
 * one country fails outright on ids another country already holds. Scoped to the country
 * they coexist happily, which is what the identifier actually means -- unique within the
 * dataset for that country, never a global handle.
 *
 * This pairs with LocationImporter::citiesBySourceId(), which looks a row up within the
 * country for the same reason. Before both changes the importer matched purely on the
 * integer and quietly renamed the Indian city, moved it under a British region and left
 * its country code pointing at India.
 *
 * Widening a unique key never rejects rows the narrower one accepted, so this cannot fail
 * on existing data. Idempotent: the key is only rebuilt when it is still the single-column
 * one.
