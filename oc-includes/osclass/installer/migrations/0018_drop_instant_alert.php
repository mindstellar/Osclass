 * Remove the dead "instant" alert email template.
 *
 * The INSTANT alert type was never dispatched — cron only ran HOURLY/DAILY/WEEKLY —
 * so its mail builder and hook are gone and struct.sql no longer seeds the
 * alert_email_instant page. This drops the seeded (b_indelible, so the admin UI
 * can't) template from existing installs: its per-locale descriptions first to
 * satisfy the foreign key, then the page itself.
 *
 * Idempotent: a DELETE matching no rows is a no-op, so re-running is safe.
