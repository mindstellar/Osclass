/**
 * Gives the three navigable billing pages -- the wallet, the package picker and
 * the buyer's own orders -- the rewrite preferences every other user-area route
 * has had since 3.x. Without them osc_billing_wallet_url() and its siblings had
 * nothing to build a path from and emitted a query string even on a site with
 * rewriting on, the only account links that did.
 *
 * They sit under the account prefix, beside user/dashboard and user/items,
 * because that is what they are -- account pages, not a section of their own.
 *
 * The POST targets (osc_billing_upgrade_url(), osc_item_upgrade_url()) get no
 * preference here on purpose: a form action is never read, shared or bookmarked,
 * and carrying an item id and a feature name through a path buys nothing for the
 * rewrite complexity it costs.
 *
 * Nothing breaks for an install that skips this: index.php answers the
 * query-string form regardless of what rules exist, so links already in the wild
 * -- and the gateway callback, which is deliberately left on ?page=billing --
 * keep resolving.
 *
 * Idempotent: INSERT IGNORE against the (s_section, s_name) unique key.
