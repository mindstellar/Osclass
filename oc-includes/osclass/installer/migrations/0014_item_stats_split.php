/**
 * Split t_item_stats into per-listing totals and a site-wide daily rollup.
 *
 * t_item_stats was keyed (fk_i_item_id, dt_date): one row per listing per day it
 * saw any traffic, carrying seven secondary indexes and pruned by nothing. A
 * listing live two months with daily traffic was sixty rows, so the table grew
 * with views rather than with listings and became the largest and hottest table
 * in the schema. The indexes cost roughly twice what the data did, and six of
 * the seven existed only for the admin reported-listings screen.
 *
 * Nothing ever read a single listing's counts for a single day. Every reader
 * summed the whole history back into one number per listing, and the only
 * consumer of the date dimension at all was the admin reports chart, which
 * aggregates across every listing and groups by date. So the date dimension did
 * not need listing granularity:
 *
 *   t_item_stats        one row per listing, totals, 1:1 with t_item
 *   t_item_stats_daily  one row per (day, write bucket), site-wide
 *
 * i_bucket spreads concurrent writes across eight rows per day. Without it every
 * view on the site would contend on a single row for the current date, which
 * would be a worse hotspot than the per-listing rows this replaces.
 *
 * Both totals and history are carried across, so per-listing view counts and the
 * reports chart read the same after the upgrade as before it.
 *
 * The rebuild is a create-insert-rename rather than an ALTER: changing the
 * primary key rewrites the table anyway, and on an install with millions of rows
 * the grouped insert into a fresh table is far cheaper than an in-place rebuild
 * that carries all eight indexes along with it.
 *
 * Idempotent, and safe to re-run after an interrupted attempt: the guard below
 * returns early once the primary key is narrowed, the scratch table is dropped
 * before use, and the rollup backfill is deterministic so INSERT IGNORE either
 * writes a (date, bucket) row or leaves the identical one already there.
