/**
 * Convert every core table on this install from the legacy 3-byte `utf8` charset
 * to `utf8mb4`, so 4-byte characters (emoji, many CJK/supplementary code points)
 * store and round-trip intact instead of being truncated or replaced.
 *
 * The charset/collation pair is frozen at utf8mb4 / utf8mb4_general_ci and must
 * stay byte-identical to the fresh-install schema in installer/struct.sql: the
 * engine default collation differs between servers (MySQL 8 utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci
 * vs MariaDB utf8mb4_uca1400_ai_ci), so the collation is always stated explicitly
 * and never left to the engine.
 *
 * The collation is utf8mb4_general_ci, not utf8mb4_unicode_ci, on purpose. The
 * legacy tables are utf8_general_ci; utf8mb4_general_ci is its charset-widened
 * successor with the same simplified per-character weights over the shared BMP
 * range, so CONVERT preserves the existing equality, sort and uniqueness
 * behaviour. utf8mb4_unicode_ci uses full UCA weights that treat some distinct
 * strings as equal (e.g. 'ß' == 'ss'), which would both change search/sort
 * results and can make CONVERT fail with a duplicate-key error on a UNIQUE column
 * that holds two rows equal under UCA but distinct under general_ci — neither is
 * acceptable on a live install.
 *
 * The conversion has to reproduce a fresh install exactly, which forces three
 * corrections around a plain `ALTER TABLE ... CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET`:
 *
 *  1. FK-bound char columns. A column in a foreign key cannot have its charset
 *     changed while the constraint exists (error 1832), and disabling
 *     FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS does not lift that DDL rule. Only char/varchar foreign
 *     keys are affected (integer keys are untouched by a charset change), so just
 *     those are dropped before the convert and recreated after — verbatim, with
 *     the same name, columns, reference and referential actions. struct.sql declares
 *     no ON DELETE/ON UPDATE rules (all default RESTRICT/NO ACTION, which SHOW CREATE
 *     omits), so the core keys re-emit nothing; but a third-party char/varchar FK with
 *     a non-default action (CASCADE / SET NULL / SET DEFAULT) has that action preserved
 *     so its data-integrity behaviour is not silently dropped by the convert.
 *
 *  2. TEXT widening. CONVERT preserves byte capacity, so it silently promotes
 *     TEXT->MEDIUMTEXT and MEDIUMTEXT->LONGTEXT (utf8mb4 is up to 4 bytes/char).
 *     A fresh install keeps the declared TEXT/MEDIUMTEXT types, so each widened
 *     column is shrunk back to its original type afterwards. Data authored under
 *     the old 3-byte TEXT limits always fits the same-tier utf8mb4 type.
 *
 *  3. FK index names. Recreating a foreign key through ALTER names its supporting
 *     index after the constraint, whereas a fresh install (inline FK at CREATE
 *     TABLE) names it after the column. Each recreated FK index is renamed back to
 *     the name it had before the drop so both paths match.
 *
 * Re-entrancy. MySQL auto-commits DDL and there is no rollback, so a CONVERT that
 * throws mid-run leaves the schema partly converted with the FKs already dropped;
 * the runner does not record the migration, so the next upgrade retries this file.
 * To make that retry fully correct, the char/varchar FK set and the original TEXT
 * column types are captured BEFORE anything is dropped and persisted durably into
 * t_preference. On a retry the snapshot is read back instead of being recomputed
 * from the now-FK-less live schema (where the dropped keys are invisible), so every
 * FK is recreated and every widened TEXT column is restored to its true original
 * type. Each step is guarded against the current live state (drop only existing
 * keys, recreate only missing ones, CONVERT/MODIFY are idempotent no-ops when
 * already at target), and the snapshot row is deleted only after a full success.
 *
 * Only tables owned by this install are touched — enumerated via
 * SHOW TABLES LIKE '<DB_TABLE_PREFIX>%' (with LIKE metacharacters in the prefix
 * escaped so `_` and `%` match literally) — so third-party tables sharing the same
 * database are never rewritten.
 *
 * Ancient-server caveat: on InnoDB before MySQL 5.7 / MariaDB 10.2 the 767-byte
 * index-prefix limit can reject the wider utf8mb4 columns. Such servers need
 * innodb_default_row_format=DYNAMIC (or ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC per table) plus
 * innodb_large_prefix=ON before this runs. Shopclass's supported floor
 * (MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.2+) defaults to DYNAMIC and a 3072-byte prefix, so no
 * per-table row-format clause is needed here; supporting older engines is out of
 * scope and documented rather than handled.
