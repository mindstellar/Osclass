/**
 * Add t_item_upload_tmp, the ledger of photos uploaded to a listing form before the
 * listing itself is saved.
 *
 * The photo uploader staged this list in $_SESSION, so uploading a photo started a
 * session — an osclass cookie that then defeats reverse-proxy caching for the rest of the
 * visit. The rows here are keyed by an unguessable per-form upload token (carried in a
 * cookie), which lets the "remove photo" action authorise a delete without a session, and
 * lets an abandoned upload be pruned. The temp files themselves are already swept by the
 * hourly cron; this only tracks which token owns which file.
 *
 * Idempotent: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS, so re-running after an interrupted upgrade
 * leaves an existing table alone.
