/**
 * A gateway's reading of an inbound webhook or return-URL hit.
 *
 * The gateway has already verified the request's signature by the time it builds one of
 * these -- only the plugin knows its provider's scheme, so that check cannot live in
 * core. What core does with the result is verify the money: the amount and currency
 * reported here are checked against the stored order before anything is fulfilled.
 *
 * That division matters. A callback is attacker-reachable input; a gateway that trusts
 * its numbers ships the classic tampered-callback bug, where a request claiming a paid
 * order for a fraction of the price is honoured. Core performing the comparison means
 * no plugin author can forget it.
