 * Interface PaymentGateway
 *
 * The entire plugin-facing surface of billing. A gateway takes money and reports one
 * thing back: this order is paid. It never learns what a premium listing is, what a
 * post quota is, or how either is enforced -- core converts credits into entitlements
 * on its own, so a gateway written today keeps working against features added later.
 *
 * Core never sees a card number, an API key, or a provider's signing secret. Those
 * live in the plugin, which is what keeps the regulatory surface out of core.
 *
 * Register an implementation on init:
 *
 *     osc_add_hook('init', function () {
 *         PaymentGatewayRegistry::instance()->register(new MyGateway());
 *     });
