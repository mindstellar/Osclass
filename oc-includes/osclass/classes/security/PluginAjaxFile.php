/**
 * Resolve the `ajaxfile` of the `custom` ajax action to a file that is safe to run.
 *
 * That action ends in `require_once`, so whatever it resolves to is executed as
 * PHP. It guarded only against the literal strings '../' and '..\', which keeps
 * the include inside the plugins directory but says nothing about *what* is
 * included. The plugins tree is writable (that is how plugins install) and holds
 * plenty of non-PHP files -- README.md, composer.lock, .mo catalogues, whatever a
 * plugin unpacks or an upload handler drops there. Any one of those, included,
 * runs as code, so a plugin that stores caller-supplied content under its own
 * folder turned a path parameter into arbitrary execution.
 *
 * Two rules close that, and neither narrows what a working plugin can ask for:
 *
 *   extension   the target must end in .php. Every file reachable this way is
 *               one a plugin meant to execute; nothing else in the tree is.
 *   containment realpath() the candidate and require the plugins directory to be
 *               its prefix. String matching on '../' misses symlinks and the
 *               encodings a filesystem accepts, whereas resolving the path first
 *               answers the only question that matters: where did it land.
 *
 * osc_ajax_plugin_url() -- the public builder plugins use to reach here -- always
 * names a .php file inside the plugins directory, so callers that were working
 * keep working.
