/**
 * Rate limit for the sign-in and password-reset forms.
 *
 * Nothing bounded password guessing: no counter, no delay, no lockout, so the
 * only cost of an attempt was the password hash. Lowering the bcrypt work
 * factor from 15 to 12 made a correct sign-in eight times quicker, and a guess
 * along with it, which is what makes a limiter the piece that has to bound the
 * guess rate rather than the hash cost.
 *
 * Two counters over one rolling window, both fed by {@see LoginAttempt}:
 *
 *   by address  every failure from one IP, whichever account it aimed at.
 *               Over the limit blocks that address outright.
 *   by account  every failure against one submitted name, from wherever.
 *               Over the limit blocks, unless the caller solved a captcha.
 *
 * The account counter is what catches guessing spread across many addresses,
 * which the address counter cannot see. It also means an attacker can hold a
 * named account shut for the length of the window, so the window is short and
 * lifts on its own.
 *
 * That is why a solved captcha excuses the account limit: the guess rate is
 * bounded already, and blocking as well would only hand an attacker a way to
 * shut a named account without getting past the captcha themselves. With
 * nothing bounding the rate the block stands.
 *
 * The caller states whether one was solved -- evaluate() does not infer it.
 * Inferring it from "a provider is configured" is what let the recovery form
 * lose its per-account limit for a captcha it had not rendered: a global setting
 * cannot answer a per-request question. The parameter defaults to false so a
 * call site that says nothing keeps the limit.
 *
 * Failures are recorded against the name as submitted whether or not it matches
 * anything. That keeps the limiter from becoming the account oracle that was
 * just closed: a name nobody holds accumulates and blocks exactly like a real
 * one, so the response never distinguishes them.
 *
 * A correct password does not lift a block. Checking before the password is
 * verified is the entire point -- otherwise the limiter would still spend a
 * bcrypt hash per attempt and remain a way to burn CPU.
