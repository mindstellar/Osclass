/**
 * Where a declared admin form's values come from and go to.

 * osc_settings_save() collects, sanitises and validates a submission without knowing
 * what it is being saved into; the store is the only part that does. That split is what
 * lets the same pipeline serve a preference page and a table-backed entity screen, and
 * it is why nothing above here has to learn that entities exist.
 *
 * A row is addressed by an integer key. A store with rows takes the key from its caller
 * and never from the request, and refuses anything that is not a positive integer rather
 * than coercing it -- so a char or compound primary key is not something to bind to.
