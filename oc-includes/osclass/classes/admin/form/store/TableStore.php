/**
 * One row of one table, addressed by its primary key.
 *
 * Bound to a table and a key rather than to a model class on purpose: every entity model
 * in core still extends the legacy DAO, which reports a failed write by returning false
 * and returns an affected-row count from update() -- so an unchanged save legitimately
 * returns 0 and reads as failure. This writes through osc_db_table() instead, which
 * throws on failure and cannot be misread.
 *
 * Rows are addressed by an integer key only, and never by one taken from the request:
 * the key comes from the caller, which is the only party that knows which row this admin
 * is allowed to be editing.
 *
 * A field maps to the column of the same name unless it declares one. A field this save
 * did not collect -- a custom one, or one whose 'depends' master is off -- is not written,
 * so its column keeps its previous value.
 *
 * A field may also say what its column takes, with 'persist': false for a field that is
 * no column at all, or a callable returning the value to write, where null writes nothing.
 * What the column takes and what the control shows are separate answers, so a derived
 * column still reads back unless the field also declares 'write_only'. A field that is no
 * column is the exception, because it has none to read.
