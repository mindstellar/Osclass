/**
 * The administrator account screen, declared once: its fields, the row of t_admin they
 * are, the rules that span more than one of them, and the route the form posts back to.
 *
 * The screen is three forms rather than one, and which one it is cannot be read off a
 * submitted value: adding has no confirmation box and demands a password, editing has a
 * confirmation box and takes a blank one as "leave it alone", and editing your own
 * account offers no account type, because nobody may promote themselves. Each is
 * therefore its own declaration under its own id, built from one method so the three
 * cannot drift.
 *
 * Three of the controls are not columns. The confirmation box exists to be compared with
 * the new password, and the current-password box is the re-authentication this screen has
 * always required before an administrator is created or changed; both are declared with
 * 'persist' => false so core collects and validates them and writes neither. The new
 * password itself is declared with a persist callable, so the column takes the hash and a
 * blank box writes nothing at all. All three are write-only, so nothing about a stored
 * password is ever drawn into the page.
