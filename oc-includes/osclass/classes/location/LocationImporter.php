/**
 * Imports one country's regions and cities, updating what is already there instead of
 * inserting beside it.
 *
 * The data source renames administrative divisions constantly — between two snapshots a
 * year apart only about a third of surviving regions still carried the same name, while
 * roughly 90% of the source ids were unchanged. So identity is `i_source_id` and nothing
 * else: a rename is an UPDATE, not a delete plus an insert.
 *
 * Two invariants hold no matter what the incoming file says:
 *
 *   - `pk_i_id` is never reassigned. Every `t_item_location.fk_i_city_id` points at it.
 *   - No row is ever deleted. A division that vanished upstream is deactivated only when
 *     it holds no listings; one that still holds listings stays fully active, because a
 *     seller's location did not stop existing when a boundary was redrawn.
