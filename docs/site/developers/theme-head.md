title: Head and body
description: Hand the document head to ShopClass with osc_head(), and let core name the page for you with osc_body_class() and osc_language_attributes().
sidebar:
  order: 19

The `<head>` used to belong entirely to the theme. Core could not put a title, a
description or a canonical on a page — not even on a page core rendered itself —
unless the theme happened to print one. Every theme therefore reimplemented the
same block, and a theme that got it slightly wrong got it wrong on every page.

## `osc_head()`

Call it as the first thing inside `<head>`:

```php
<head>
<?php osc_head(); ?>
<meta name="theme-color" content="#1b2c5e">
</head>
```

It prints, in order:

| Part | What |
|---|---|
| `charset` | `<meta charset="utf-8">` |
| `viewport` | `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` |
| `title` | `<title>` from `meta_title()`, escaped |
| `description` | `<meta name="description">`, omitted when there is none |
| `keywords` | `<meta name="keywords">`, omitted when there is none |
| `canonical` | `<link rel="canonical">`, omitted when there is none |
| `feed` | `<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">` — the current search's feed on a results page, the site's elsewhere |

and then runs the `header` hook, which is where enqueued styles and scripts, the
robots meta, and everything plugins add come from.

**Do not also call `osc_run_hook('header')`** — `osc_head()` runs it, and a second
call prints every enqueued asset twice.

### Keeping a part for yourself

Every part is opt-out. Declare only what you want to keep:

```php
osc_add_theme_support('head', array('feed' => false));
```

Anything not named stays on, so `osc_add_theme_support('head')` on its own means
"core owns all of it". The declaration is also how core knows your head is
core-managed; `osc_head()` itself works whether or not you declared anything.

## `osc_body_class()`

```php
<body <?php osc_body_class(); ?>>
```

Prints the whole attribute, so a page with no classes prints nothing rather than
an empty `class=""`. Core names the page for you:

- the page itself — `home`, `search`, `search-category`, `item`, `item-post`,
  `item-edit`, `item-contact`, `contact`, `custom`, `login`, `register`,
  `recover`, `forgot-password`, `user-public-profile`, `error-404`
- an account view — its own class *and* a shared `user`, so one selector reaches
  the whole signed-in area: `user-dashboard`, `user-profile`, `user-items`,
  `user-alerts`, `user-change-email`, `user-change-password`,
  `user-change-username`
- a static page — `page` and `page-{internal name}`
- the visitor — `logged-in` or `logged-out`
- the context — `lang-{locale}`, `theme-{theme}`, and `rtl` on a right-to-left
  locale

Pass your own alongside them, as a string or a list:

```php
<body <?php osc_body_class('has-sidebar'); ?>>
```

`osc_body_class_list()` returns the same classes as an array. Both pass through
the `body_class` filter, which receives the computed list and whatever the caller
passed — that is where a plugin adds one.

Every class is lowercased and reduced to `[a-z0-9_-]`; a static page's internal
name is typed by an admin and lands in an attribute, so it is not trusted.

## `osc_language_attributes()`

```php
<html <?php osc_language_attributes(); ?>>
```

Prints `lang="en-US" dir="ltr"`, with `dir="rtl"` on a right-to-left locale.
Filterable through `language_attributes`. Pass `false` to get the string back
instead of printing it.

## None of this is required

A theme that calls none of these behaves exactly as it did. They exist so a theme
stops reimplementing them, and so core can describe a page it renders itself.
