  over 300 + commits since the last release
  There is a lot more under the hood changes, which are not listed here, but you can see them in the commit log.

Backend rewrite was a lot of work, but now it is finally done, and it is much more user-friendly. Many new components/APIs will be introduced in the future. So, if you are a developer, that'll make you happy. It was a marathon job for the last two to three months, and I am very happy with the result. I hope you will enjoy it.
